Multi-Modal Analysis for ENG315

As the title suggests, the purpose of this project is to analyze successful, well-designed websites to determine how they work and present your conclusions in a multi-modal format. In an effort to provide you with topics you are truly interested in, I have provided three lists of potential sites for you to choose from. The three lists include well over 100 sites, so you should be able to find some that intrigue you.

Once you have perused some of these sites, you will need to choose three â€“ one non-profit site, one blog, and one corporate/private site. You will complete the analysis exercise, then based on the answers to the questions there, you will draft a 1200-word multi-modal project that illustrates your findings, compares and contrasts the elements of the three sites, and draws some conclusions about successful websites.
