				<h3>Content</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="outer"><span>Audience/purpose: Who is the intended audience? 
					What is the intended purpose? How does the site make its intended audience and purpose clear? </span>
					<ul>
						<li class="inner"><strong>Wil Wheaton: </strong>Audience: Wil Wheaton fans (he was a character on ST:TNG).  
						Purpose: people interested in reading about his life or politically progressive rants. 
						It is hard to determine audience and purpose</li>
						<li class="inner"><strong>Khan Academy: </strong>Stated on home page: audience is Learners, Teachers, Districts, Parents. P
						urpose is “provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere” </li>
						<li class="inner"><strong>Disney: </strong>Audience: prospective park visitors, employees,investors, Purpose: to “sell” Disney as an awesome place to work, visit, or invest in. 
						Both audience and purpose are clear</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li class="outer"><span>Navigation: Is the navigation intuitive, clear, functional?
					How is the navigation structured? </span>
						<ul>
							<li class="inner"><strong>Wil Wheaton: </strong>Hard to navigate. It took me a while to figure out that the 
							structure was his posted content with products in a sidebar.</li>
							<li class="inner"><strong>Khan Academy: </strong> Navigation is easy. 
							The four audience sections have big blue buttons in the center of the screen, making them eye-catching and easy to find.  
							The pull-down list and search box of courses were harder to find. They should be bigger.Less obvious is the info 
							“below the fold”. I didn’t see how to get there at first</li>
							<li class="inner"><strong>Disney: </strong>Navigation is easy.  It all takes place in the nav bar at the top.</li>
